                <h2>Indian revolutionary freedom fighter</h2>

                <p><strong>Bhagat Singh</strong> was a charismatic Indian revolutionary and a hero of the early 20th-century Indian independence movement. He was a vocal critic of British rule in India and was involved in two high-profile attacks on British authorities. He participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer in what was to be retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist.He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.</p>
